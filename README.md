## Implementation

- As part of this assignment, we need to build APIâ€™s for the following feature. As a user, I can select any theatre in the city. On selecting the theatre, I should be able to see the dates of next 7 days.
- I can click on any date and the page should load to give me all the movies in that theatre on that given date. Movies should contain details of all the showtimes.
